Build a mobile app called **TiffinTracker (Mobile)** — a single-user, offline-first app to track daily tiffin for **both lunch and dinner**. Deliver a runnable Git repo with full source, README, and demo data.

Tech stack (must use)
- Expo (React Native) + TypeScript
- Local DB: SQLite via `expo-sqlite` (or a small wrapper like `expo-sqlite-orm`)
- State: React Context or Zustand
- UI: React Native components (mobile-first), minimal dependencies (no heavy UI libs unless necessary)
- Tests: unit tests for utilities (Jest) — optional but preferred
- Optional: build scripts / instructions to produce an APK (Expo EAS or classic build instructions)

Data model
- DayEntry (per calendar date)
  - id: string (GUID)
  - date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' (date-only)
  - lunchType: "None" | "Half" | "Full"
  - dinnerType: "None" | "Half" | "Full"
  - lunchPrice: number (optional) — if null, resolve using settings
  - dinnerPrice: number (optional)
  - notes: string (optional) — general note for the day
  - createdAt, updatedAt timestamps
- Settings (single record)
  - halfPrice: number (default 50)
  - fullPrice: number (default 60)
  - currency: string (default "INR")

Business rules
- Each date has one DayEntry (store None entries explicitly).
- For reports, price resolution: if lunchPrice/dinnerPrice is present use it; otherwise use settings (halfPrice/fullPrice) according to type.
- None entries contribute zero to totals.
- Date stored date-only to avoid timezone issues.

UI / Features
1. Onboarding / Demo data
   - On first run seed demo month (e.g., current month) so calendar shows sample entries. Allow user to clear demo data.
2. Home / Quick Entry
   - Shows today's date.
   - Two rows: Lunch and Dinner. Each row has three large segmented buttons: None, Half (₹50), Full (₹60) and an optional "notes" icon.
   - Save button (or auto-save on selection).
3. Calendar view (monthly)
   - Grid calendar with small indicators per day:
     - Show two small dots or stacked indicators: one for lunch (color per type) and one for dinner (color per type).
     - Colors: Grey=None, Yellow=Half, Green=Full.
   - Tap a date to open Day Detail (edit/delete).
4. Day Detail / Edit
   - Show date, current lunch/dinner selection, editable notes, manual price overrides for lunch/dinner.
   - Save / Delete buttons.
5. Reports
   - Date range picker (preset: this month, last month).
   - Show counts: halfLunchCount, fullLunchCount, noneLunchCount; halfDinnerCount, fullDinnerCount, noneDinnerCount.
   - Combine totals: totalLunchAmount, totalDinnerAmount, grandTotal.
   - CSV export (client-side) to share via OS share dialog or export to file.
6. Settings
   - Edit Half price and Full price (these affect calculation when entry prices are missing).
   - Toggle demo data on/off, clear all data.
7. Sync / Backup (optional)
   - Optional export/import JSON backup to copy between devices manually (no cloud).
8. Offline-first
   - Entire app works offline. All writes go to local SQLite DB.
9. Date handling
   - Store and display dates in local device date (YYYY-MM-DD). Avoid timezone issues by using date-only strings.

UX / Accessibility
- Mobile-first: large tappable controls.
- Use icons where helpful; keep UI minimal and fast.
- Support landscape/portrait.

Code & architecture
- Simple MVVM-ish or clean separation:
  - Screens -> hooks/services -> db layer -> models
- DB layer: a small wrapper to run SQL queries and map to models.
- Use TypeScript types everywhere.
- Provide sample unit tests for report calculation utilities (counts and totals).
- Include an example `seedDemoData()` to populate current month.

Deliverables & README
- Full Expo project that runs with `npm install` and `expo start`.
- Instructions to run in Expo Go and how to build APK optionally.
- README with run steps, seed/demo info, and sample usage.
- Provide screenshots or GIF (optional).

Acceptance criteria
- I can run `npm install` and `expo start`, open the app in Expo Go, and:
  - mark lunch and dinner for today as None/Half/Full,
  - view history in calendar with separate indicators for lunch and dinner,
  - edit past days and set price overrides,
  - generate a report for a month that correctly calculates per-meal counts and totals (example: if in demo month lunchHalf=12, lunchFull=14 then lunch total = 12*50 + 14*60),
  - export report as CSV to device.
